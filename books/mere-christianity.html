                <h2><i>Mere Christianity</i> by C.S. Lewis</h2>
                <p><strong>Published:</strong> 1952</p>
                <p>An introduction to the worldview held by Christians written for soldiers who were navigating a
                    world that felt meaningless post WW1. Lewis argues for the logical validity of Christianity and
                    explains its basic beliefs with clarity and wit.
                    Passages in this book often feel like a light being turned on in a room you didn't know you were
                    sitting. his essay on pride toward the end has been something I've reread 9 or 10 times.
                    Something in his writing style makes him feel as though you are listening to an old friend, and
                    that tone not acedemic or preachy managed to communicate ideas that became instrumental in
                    building and eastablishing my faith. </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>"God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is
                        no such thing." - C.S. Lewis</li>
                    <li>"Aim at Heaven and you will get earth 'thrown in': aim at earth and you will get neither." -

                    <li>"A proud man is always looking down on things and people: and, of course, as long as you are

                    <li>"It is not your business to succeed, but to do right; when you have done so, the rest lies with

                    <li>"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly

                        C.S. Lewis</li>

                    <li>"He died not for men, but for each man. If each man had been the only man made, He would have

                    <li>"If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end; if you look for comfort you will not
                        get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin, and in the end,
                        despair." - C.S. Lewis</li>
