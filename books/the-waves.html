                <h2><i>The Waves</i> by Virginia Woolf</h2>
                <p><strong>Published:</strong> 1931</p>
                <p>I am convinced Virginia Woolf has a sixth and maybe even seventh sense that allows her to see
                    things that we five-sensed creatures are blind to. I do not know how else she could have written
                    this book. It is a novel with no dialogue. The reader moves between the characters' thoughts,
                    but at a layer deeper than thought. It is more like reading the subconscious impressions that
                    bubble beneath the surface of six characters as they encounter life from beginning to end,
                    presented in parallel with the course of a single day and the changes in lighting and scenery
                    that come with it.

                    I say she must be something more than ordinary because it would already be a miracle for an
                    author to understand themselves deeply enough to discover these subconscious shapes in their own
                    mind and then articulate them. Yet Virginia Woolf manages to probe this deeply into six
                    characters who have radically different motivations and personalities. She uncovers something
                    real here, and because the style stands alone, the first few pages of the book will feel like a
                    code or a collection of unrelated words and sentences. As you keep reading, the rhythm and
                    perspective begin to lull you in until you feel the waves and uncover the story through a kind
                    of echolocation, where although you are not told explicitly about the events, you can infer the
                    shapes from the ripples they cause in the characters' minds. This book tricks you into learning
                    a new language and a new way of viewing yourself and others, and for that I will always regard
                    it as one of the most valuable experiences that reading can offer.</p>
