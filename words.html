                    <p>This is my favorite book because, this story articulated aspects of myself that I have never managed to articulate. It is a Russian murder mystery, but that is only the vehicle for the narrative. This book is about the characters. It is about reason, faith, and passion personified as three brothers with depravity for a father whom they both loathe and love in their own ways, the story follows their lives and gives flesh to the drama of struggling with faith in a fallen world.</p>

                    <p>A multi-generational family drama in early 20th-century California. Steinbeck weaves themes from Genesis into the lives of a vast array of characters to draw out the timeless struggle between good and evil in each of us.Normally I'm an advocate for the value of activley reading over passivly listening to a book, but in this case the narritive is well suited to spoken word. I included a sample of the audio below.</p>

						<p>This book was the most surprising read for me. I picked it up one October expecting a simple spooky story about a monster. That is not what I was in for. I got instead a cautionary tale of hubris, a layered narrative about creation and creator, the consequences of belonging to a world without love. It was like a merge to <i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>. Mary Shelley is a genius and this book goes far beyond what the modern conception of <i>Frankenstein</i> is. A funny aside is that the book was first published anonymously. After being lauded as a work of genius, it was revealed the author was a 19-year-old girl. Critics lost their minds. They insisted that Percy Shelley must have been the real author or the true mind behind it, because to the 1800s literary critic it was inconceivable that a girl could have produced a work that they had attributed to genius.

						This breaking of expectations and proving that "Creative Genius" and "Female" were not incompatible categories may have had generational ripple effects that lead to the way I'm writing this website right now. Mary and her husband Percy Shelley were very close to Lord Byron, the person who initiated the ghost-story challenge that <i>Frankenstein</i> was born out of. This close friend, Lord Byron, had just one child, Ada Lovelace, who would later become the first computer programmer and the first person to postulate the value of loops. It is possible that Mary’s success as a young girl was an inspiration to young Ada, encouraging her to achieve something truly great even if her ambitions lay outside what was expected of women in 1800s England. </p>

                        world that felt meaningless post WW1. Lewis argues for the logical validity of Christianity and
                        explains its basic beliefs with clarity and wit.
						Passages in this book often feel like a light being turned on in a room you didn't know you were sitting.  his essay on pride toward the end has been something I've reread 9 or 10 times. Something in his writing style makes him feel as though you are listening to an old friend, and that tone not acedemic or preachy managed to communicate ideas that became instrumental in building and eastablishing my faith. </p>

                    <p> I can't separate this story from the memory of my family sitting together, my parents reading aloud, struggling to make out the words when my turn to read came, and the quiet warmth that only a family provides.

					But as CS Lewis “No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally – and often far more – worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.” and i reread this in my 20's to find a compelling story and a rekindling of an innocent loning for virtue courage and sacrafice. Im excited to return to narnia with my own kids when they are old enough and trust that  a doorway that opened once in childhood and somehow remains open even now.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>I am convinced Virginia Woolf has a sixth and maybe even seventh sense that allows her to see things that we five-sensed creatures are blind to. I do not know how else she could have written this book. It is a novel with no dialogue. The reader moves between the characters' thoughts, but at a layer deeper than thought. It is more like reading the subconscious impressions that bubble beneath the surface of six characters as they encounter life from beginning to end, presented in parallel with the course of a single day and the changes in lighting and scenery that come with it.

					I say she must be something more than ordinary because it would already be a miracle for an author to understand themselves deeply enough to discover these subconscious shapes in their own mind and then articulate them. Yet Virginia Woolf manages to probe this deeply into six characters who have radically different motivations and personalities. She uncovers something real here, and because the style stands alone, the first few pages of the book will feel like a code or a collection of unrelated words and sentences. As you keep reading, the rhythm and perspective begin to lull you in until you feel the waves and uncover the story through a kind of echolocation, where although you are not told explicitly about the events, you can infer the shapes from the ripples they cause in the characters' minds. This book tricks you into learning a new language and a new way of viewing yourself and others, and for that I will always regard it as one of the most valuable experiences that reading can offer.</p>

Through chance events he ends up running a mining operation on the agean sea with Zorba. A stout illeterate hairy old man whos life is marked by a fullness and pursuit of beauty above all else. The only reason this bok was hard to read is becuase it made me constantly want to put it down and buy a plane ticket to greece.and live with the fullbody recklessness that Zorba calls the narrator to. </p>
